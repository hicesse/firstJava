# Java Practice Project – Simple Game System

This program was built as part of my Java learning process and coursework.
The main goal of this project is to practice core Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, class design, interfaces, and basic input handling.

For future updates, I plan to expand this project into a more complex system for a simple game. Ideally, I want to be able to run a small game engine locally on my laptop so I can get more hands-on practice and improve my understanding of system design and game logic.

At the current stage, this implementation is already sufficient for this week’s learning target. One of the upcoming focuses will be designing a **slot-based system** to manage equipment and inventory flow. This will help structure how items are equipped, unequipped, and interacted with in a scalable way.

In the long term, I also plan to write a storyline and gradually integrate it into the system as the project grows. This project is intended to evolve step by step alongside my learning progress.
